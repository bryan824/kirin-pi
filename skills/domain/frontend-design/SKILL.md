# Frontend Design

Give the interface a point of view; a collection of familiar components is not a
visual system. This skill owns aesthetic direction and orchestration, not every
domain rule.

- Name one aesthetic direction, then express a small visual thesis through type,
  color, rhythm, layout, and only the interactions that reinforce it.
- Establish foundations before polish. Coordinate `frontend-accessibility`,
  `frontend-layout`, `frontend-writing`, `frontend-typography`,
  `frontend-color`, `frontend-motion`, and `frontend-polish` by name; let each
  own its rules. Add `apple-interface` only for an explicitly Apple direction.
- Preserve existing tokens, components, density, and styling conventions unless
  redesign is explicit. Do not add arbitrary values to evade the system.
- Reject generic defaults: unconsidered SaaS-blue or purple gradients, centered
  card stacks, interchangeable hero-and-columns layouts, and decorative motion
  without a purpose.
- Stress real content before calling a design complete: long names, amounts,
  IDs, labels, localized strings, and narrow widths need deliberate wrapping,
  truncation, shrinking, or reflow.
- For implementation, build working project-native code rather than a mood
  board or placeholder. For a holistic review, follow
  [the shared review contract](references/REVIEW.md). Review-only requests stay
  read-only; implementation requests build the agreed scope.

Carry forward a named direction, a coherent small system, and code or evidence
that survives content stress.
