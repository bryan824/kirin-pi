# Frontend Typography

**Typography is controlled restraint.** Make reading and meaning stable before
making type expressive: each role earns its face, scale step, weight, and line
behavior.

- Choose and load only the font faces, styles, and weights the interface uses;
  retain a compatible fallback and avoid synthetic emphasis unless it is
  intentional. Build a small role-based scale whose visual hierarchy follows
  the content hierarchy.
- Tune line height and measure for the role, not a one-size rule. Decide whether
  each text lane wraps, breaks long tokens, or truncates; truncation of useful
  content needs a way to reach the full value.
- Stabilize changing money, counts, and IDs with tabular figures where supported.
  Inputs should inherit the intended type treatment, keep entered text legible,
  and never make a placeholder carry the label's job.
- Treat language as rendering input: set the appropriate `lang` and direction
  boundary, preserve digit order, isolate mixed-direction values when needed,
  and use punctuation and nonbreaking opportunities deliberately.
- Stress every text policy in narrow lanes with long localized names, money,
  IDs, and labels. `frontend-layout` keeps those lanes shrinkable and reachable;
  this skill keeps their text readable without overflow or accidental loss.
